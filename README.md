# Northstar XR 3D Files

This is a collection of 3D Print and CAD files for the [Northstar Next](https://docs.projectnorthstar.org/northstar-next/introduction) variant of the Project Northstar XR Headset. This was motivated by a need for parametric models of the headgear, as well as some spacing issues in the original 3D files. The positioning of the displays and headgear is exactly the same, with some additional features for convenience. 

## Additional Features
* Display adapter holder
* Easily detachable electronics holder
* Simple adapter for BoboVR Headgear

## Planned Features
* Cable Guides
* Fully enclosed electronics case
* Calibration stand adapter for the Luxonis DepthAI cameras

**NOTE:** You will need more standoffs than provided in the kit. You can purchase more [here](https://mou.sr/3Obxjzm).
